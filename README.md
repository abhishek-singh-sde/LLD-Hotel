# LLD-Hotel
LLD (Low Level Design) implementation of a hotel booking system (similar to OYO) using C++

Used OOPS concepts like abstraction and encapsulation to keep only relevant data visible to end user.
Passed and returned objects between functions and then used the relevant function calls.
User can opt to search via different parameters like pincode, cutoff ratings, place, city etc.
